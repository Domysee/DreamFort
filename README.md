# Dream Journaling Made Effortless - With a New Method

It's essential to record dreams right after waking up. Usually the whole dream is written down.

## DreamFort - The No-Fluff Dream Journal

With a 2-step process, you can jot down keywords about your dreams after waking up, and enter the rest later.  
With the keywords you'll remember the dreams much longer, and can write down the whole story whenever you're fully awake and have the time to do so. The daily commute suits perfectly (but don't do it while driving!).

| 1. Enter keywords, right after waking up, takes only 30 seconds | 2. Enter the whole story, sometime throughout the day |
